# Dealing with the Spirits

## Description

_Dealing with the Spirits_ is a text-based negotiations video game. In this world, powerful spirits dominate the world, and humans are considered barbaric, less than vermin. You are a desperate human thief trying to steal yourself a better life. Your plan is to steal whatever you can from the great spirit House of Healing.

Unfortunately, when you're caught, you need to use your wits -- and whatever items you had been able to grab -- to negotiate your way past a series of spirits, each of which might help you escape... if you offer them just the right things.

Can you make it back home with as many purloined goods as possible?

# Tech Stuff

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download this package as a zip (extra help [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
1. Open up a Terminal window and navigate to where you saved the package. (extra help [here](https://www.macworld.com/article/2042378/master-the-command-line-navigating-files-and-folders.html)).
1. When in the root directory, type `make` and hit return. The game should create itself here.
1. I recommend making your terminal window full screen here, or at least 80 characters wide.
1. Once the game is created, type `make run` to start.
1. If you ever run into any trouble, clear the game with `make clean`, and then try running `make` and then `make run` once more.

## Uninstallation
Simply delete the folder you downloaded, wash your hands, and have a little party.

## Software Requirements

This game currently works directly through the command line, with a simple, C++ codebase. You should ideally have C++ 11 installed. The game is optimised for Linux or MacOS usage -- it may work on Windows machines with a command line client like PuTTY, but this has not been tested. Beyond this, all reasonably modern hardware should suffice.

If you have a Mac and you're not sure whether this game will work on your device, it probably will.
