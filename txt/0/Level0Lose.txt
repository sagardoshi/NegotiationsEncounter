Prologue: Caught -- YOU LOSE
================================================================================

Lepha shakes her head. Her ears flap in slow-motion from side to side.

***

"This is a joke," she says. "Human, you are not ready for this, whatever you
think of yourself. I wish you thought more carefully."

What is she going to do? Can you run?

***

Just as you start moving to try to run around her legs, she moves swifter than
you expect and grabs you with her trunk. She deposits you unceremoniously in
the crate you were hiding in and slams the lid before you can scramble out.

She picks up the crate and begins stepping away. Each step jolts your body, and
it's all you can do to keep from bouncing around inside the crate.

***

This goes on for a while. You hear snippets of sounds from outside the crate,
but it's all a jumble, and then you go back to being pummeled by the inside of
the crate.

***

More time passes, and then suddenly, you get deposited onto the ground.

You hear Lepha's voice, still melancholic, still vast, speaking to you. "Let
this be a lesson to you, human."

***

But it's odd. She doesn't speak the line in admonishment, as if delivering as
punishment. She speaks it imperatively, as if literally instructing you to
learn.

And then she's gone.
