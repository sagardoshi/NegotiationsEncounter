Prologue: Caught
================================================================================

You heft your bag of loot. Did you get everything you needed? Check your
inventory.


***inventory***

Okay, that looks like everything you had on your list. You take in a whiff of
the herbal scents filling the Pantry. But you cannot tarry. Now it's time
to get out, just as carefully as you came in.

You look around the enormous, dark chamber. The wardrobes, closets, and
dressers lay ransacked, each one tougher to reach than you had expected. The
spirits must really be larger than you expected. The cabinet doors, ornate and
lacquered, swing ajar, their contents disheveled, spilling out.

***

At first, you had intended to cover your tracks. To close up each intricate box,
stopper each bottle of unguent, and replace each pack of tools. But it no
longer seems worth it. They'll find out pretty quickly what happened.

The priority now is just to get as far away as quickly as possible. But how?

***

Your eyes light on the one extra feature you noticed on your way in: the window.

You hadn't expected to have an easy way out, but this is perfect. Like
everything else in the pantry of the spirits, the window is enormous. It is
more than big enough for you to get through. Unfortunately, like everything
else, it is also quite high.

***

You waste no time. Setting down your bag of loot, you quietly push over some
boxes lying nearby. Even the boxes are large.

But as you start to manoeuvre them into place, you realise you didn't count on
their weight. As you try to lift one on top of another, you suddenly lose your
balance.

You feel yourself and the box both weightless, as both of you tip over.

***

The box falls and -- curses! -- it seems to be full of glass. The crash of
broken glass is loud loud loud. Your heart sinks as almost immediately, you
hear a sound that terrifies you to your soul: a sonorous, echoing trumpet.

The ground shakes. She approaches.

***

You look around, nerves jangling. You reach into the nearby drawer and pull
whatever else is in reach and in sight and toss it into your bag. You throw
your bag into a box.

And then, not quite knowing what else to do, in a burst of
panic -- you jump into the box yourself. You slide the lid closed over your
head. Perhaps she won't notice you in here?

***

You can see a tiny sliver of the room through the cracks in the crate. The door
swings open, and light from the hallway shoots in a ray into the dark
pantry. A silhouette looms in the doorway.

***

You first see the granite legs, as solid as you've heard, rising up into a
heaving, powerful core. She is dressed in leather armor, with weapons teeming
from a toolbelt. She stands upright, enormous head nearly hitting the ceiling.
Her wide, rubbery ears are shaking side to side, framing her curled, vicious
trunk.

***

Before you stands Lepha, Pharmacologist of the Spirits, here to deliver your
judgment. And despite your hiding place, you can tell right away: she sees
exactly where you are.
