Level 2: Toto
================================================================================

...and enter a party? There are lights directly in your eyes, and you're
briefly blinded. But you can hear an undercurrent of guffaws, speech, hums,
snorts, and clucks. It sounds like a farm.

Then your eyes adjust and the view seems even more ridiculous than expected.

***

You appear to be outdoors in a broad courtyard. It looks more like a clearing
in the woods, with grass underfoot and open air above. In the center is a large
hill, bright spotlights shining onto it. The hill is piled layers thick with
tables, chairs, barrels, and slabs of wood.

Everywhere there seems to be movement. That movement, most unexpectedly,
consists of an uncountable number of rabbits!

***

They're all yelling to one another loudly and fighting for a space on the hill,
kicking those below with their hind legs. Every rabbit is holding a clay bowl
filled with sloshing liquid.

Some rabbits are perched partway up the pile, apparently telling hilarious
stories to their small audience of guffawing rabbits. Others are playing games,
pouring a drink from a height into the mouth of other rabbits below.

***

You can't seem to see how many there are on the hill. When you focus on one
group, more and more rabbits seem to fill your vision. When you close your eyes
or shake your head, it's as if the rabbits themselves are shaken free, and you
can see fewer. But then, once more, they start quickly filling the space you
can see until you blink once more.

***

The rabbit spirits -- for what else can they be -- all seem to be in a state of
chaotic revelry. How had you not heard their racket while approaching?

As you try to make sense of the madness, you hear a strong, more guttural
series of clucks and stomps. It's coming from the top of the hill. Some of the
rabbits stop their playing and look up to the summit.

***

The spotlights shine up to the top, and up there is a massive, crudely painted
flag with the number two on it in blue. Sitting underneath it, on a throne of
corn stalks and clay is one enormous rabbit. And he's looking right at you.

***

"Human!" he shouts, echoing in the sudden silence. You shudder. Something about
his low voice drives through you, leaving you feeling lightheaded. "Have you
come to join the party?"

You lift your hand to shield your eyes and say. "Uh, no, not really. I'm just
hoping to find a way out."

***

He launches himself, leaping from his throne high into the air and landing with
a crash just in front of you. You stagger back and almost fall.

He shouts just as loudly in front of you as he did when he was back on the
hill. It is deafening. "My name is Ome Tochtli, and you are in the chamber of
Centzon Tototin!" he says.

***

Behind, there is a roar. The rabbits on the hill all lift their bowls, cheer,
and take a gulp.

You try to repeat his name. And you don't even come close. He laughs, a laugh
that shakes your bones. "Just call me, or any one of us, Toto."

***

"Good to meet you, Toto," you stutter. "I just need to get back home," you
manage. "Could I offer you a gift for safe passage through?"

"Hmm," says Toto. "Now that's an interesting prospect! We've never bargained
with a human before." He turns back to the hill. "What do you say, friends?
Shall we try it?"

***

There is another chorus of cheers. Again the rabbits all lift their bowls and
drink. One particularly intoxicated rabbit falls off his table and clatters
down the hill. No one pays him any mind.

***

"Well, then," says Toto, turning back to you. "We're always up for a challenge.
But you better have something interesting to offer. Or else you can just stay
here with us and drink."

You nod. "I think you might like what I have for you." You managed it with the
bird spirits. Why not with the rabbit spirits?

***

Without warning, Toto grabs you by the scruff of your neck and bounds back up
the hill. From the cries you hear, he seems to have squashed some of his
smaller friends on his way back up.

At the top, under his flag, he sits on his throne. There is a table in front of
him, and a small stool for you to sit on.

***

He gestures at the table and grins at you, buck teeth glinting in the
spotlights. "Alright then, human. Make your offer."
