The spotlights are too bright. From everywhere, the light seems to blind you.
The cold wind too, has picked up once more.

***

You glance at the table before you and know that your offer -- your last chance
-- has failed. You can sense Toto's impatience.

He glances around down the hill, and sees his rabbits eyeing him. They are
looking at him with judgment, appraisal. What will he do?

***

And indeed as he stands up, it all seems inevitable. "It seems," he booms over
his hill. "That our human friend doesn't actually have anything to offer us!"

The cheers, before so raucous and joyous, now have some menace.

***

"Why does the human want to leave our party anyway?" he continues, speaking to
the crowds of rabbits. "We have everything we need, don't we? Is this not the
best place to be, even if Lepha holds out a little on the good stuff?"

They roar in response.

***

You look around. Can you leap off the hill and escape? No, but there are just
endless rabbits, everywhere you turn.

Flopping ears and flea-bitten fur and watery eyes stare you down.

***

"Perhaps we simply need to have our friend get a taste of the good life. What
do you say?" the roar gets impossibly louder.

You look up and suddenly there is a pitcher in Toto's hand, and there are
rabbits crowding around him.

***

"Open up, human," Toto says.

And then the rabbits jump. They hold you down and try to pry your mouth open.
When you fight, they squeeze shut your nose until you have to gasp for air.

***

When you do, down pours the pulque. It's not like beer or wine. It's thick,
viscous, and almost stringy. The fruity smell is overpowering, and you cough.

But they keep pouring.

***

It's too much, They force you to swallow two bucketfuls. But just as you are
starting to lose air, they let you up.

You feel almost immediately woozy, but can't seem to get yourself to vomit. You
stand up, but stumble, and sit back down.

***

The rabbits clear out, and begin whooping as they stream down the hill.

Toto eyes you again. "I don't let people make a fool out of me, human. This is
the end of you. You cannot handle the pulque." He turns, getting ready to bound
away, but looks back.

"At least if you have to go, we're sending you off with the best drink in the
house. Cheers, human."

***

He bounds off. You blink and blink and your vision starts closing in on you and
at the same time you feel weirdly happy.

You start making circles with your head, like a little head dance with the sky
before you fall back prone, just where you had been forced down before.

You see the stars, spinning, and the waving number two flag.

***

And that's how you end. Fatally drunk on pulque.
