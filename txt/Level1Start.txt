You turn left and go down a hallway for a while. It's brightly lit, with
colourful flowers everywhere. You see framed photos of the Tripgor family.
There seem to be three of them. You recognise Chamoy, and then someone who
looks like her daughter, and someone who must be the grandson, Porridge.

You keep moving down the hallway until you get to a door. The door has a
chalkboard taped to it with "Porridge" scribbled in childish, messy
handwriting. You open the door.

Within, you see a tiny gorilla, wearing a baseball cap and tossing a ball
against the wall. The room has a soft mattress with drawings pasted up on the
walls. There's a toy closet, and a bright window shining a circle of light on
the wall just where Porridge is aiming his ball.

When you walk in, he pauses. "Hi! You must be here for a negotiation! Grandma
said someone would likely come knocking this morning. If you want my key,
though, I'll warn you that I drive a hard bargain, and I'm the toughest
negotiator in the family! You stand no chance!"

He strikes a fierce pose, pouting his lips, but the effect is just too cute.
You stifle a giggle. He laughs too and points to a chair.

You take your seat. The negotiation is about to begin!
