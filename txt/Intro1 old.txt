CRASH!! You fall through a roof and land in a soft pile of blankets. Ow. You
shake your head as the dust settles and look up to see a large gorilla
reclining before you.

***

She has a long, rounded face, has a pair of thin glasses perched on her short
nose. Her hair is graying a little around the edges. As the dust clears, it
seems she was napping or reading a magazine whilst sitting on her living room
armchair.

***

She looks you over silently and purses her lips in confusion. You freeze for a
few moments, and she seems to be blinking the sleep out of her eyes.

Suddenly, she speaks in a rumble. "Hello there, young human! How did you land
in our nest?"
