Burro sits back. She looks over at her structure, her monument to wood. There's
a smile on her face, and all you can hear is the rushing water. You sit there
in silence with her.

***

"I never expected that a nonsense human would appear out of nowhere and offer
me just what I need." She grins at you, a frankly scarring experience with her
long, curved front teeth filled with woodchips.

***

"But here you are, and here you have. Thank you, human." She picks up your
offer, and without even looking, tosses them over her shoulder.

You are shocked, but the contents of the offer arc gracefully through the air,
turning ever so slightly to pass through the walls of the building and land
softly on a desk inside. Perfect aim.

***

She smiles at you. "Let's get you out of here." She stands up, waddles over to
her palace. She reaches in and pulls out a block of unfinished wood.

***

As you watch, something remarkable happens. She bites into the wood. But biting
doesn't convey the speed of her chomping.

She chomps and spits and carves with such speed and ferocity that before you
realise it, a piece of human-sized wood has transformed into a beautiful,
shapely wooden key that could fit in your palm.

***

She hands it to you, smiling. As you grasp it, you look, and you see that the
handle, miraculously, has a likeness of your face whittled gently into it.
Extraordinary!

***

"Thank you," you say.

She nods and points through the woods, opposite of where you came from. "Head
in that direction, and you'll get to the door. There's just an entrance foyer
left, and then you're home free. Good luck to you, human."

***

And then she turns and faces back, already busy and muttering about her work.

***

You turn off and head in the indicated direction. It's not long before you
leave the sound of the water behind and arrive at the wall.

You place the key in the slit, the door swings open, and you step through.

***

Again a quiet hallway that erases evidence of the previous room as you step
into it. Again another door at the end. Again you open it.

This time, hopefully for the last time, you step through the door.
