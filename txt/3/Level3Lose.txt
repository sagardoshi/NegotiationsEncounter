There is no hesitation. One minute, Burro is sitting still -- if dourly -- amid
the rushing water. The next, her face cracks to reveal her impatience, and all
her frustration comes surging back.

***

This time you have no time to say anything, to call out a protest, to save
yourself by some hook or crook.

***

Burro simply grabs you by the neck and leaps into the moving stream, carrying
you with her. The force is a shock, her strength immense. She pulls you to the
middle of the river and she straddles two rocks over a deeper segment.

She turns you toward her and with dead, cold eyes says, "I don't suffer
interferers, human."

***

She thrusts you into the rushing water and holds you there. You don't have time
to take a breath as the water closes over your face.

You can see her waving form through the surface, but from the wrong side.

***

Without thinking, you open your mouth to take a breath, and in comes the water.

From there, it's just a few brief, terrifying seconds left, and then the liquid
black takes you.

***

And that's how you end. Drowned by a beaver.
