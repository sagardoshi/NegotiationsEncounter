The entire time, Lepha didn't bat an eye at the items you were pulling out.
Your theft couldn't have been a surprise to her.

***

She has been sitting forward, appraising you throughout. And now, for the first
time, she leans back. She begins to applaud. Big, slow claps. Each one echoes
around the foyer and makes her ears quiver.

***

"Bravo, human," she says. "Bravo. You have found a combination that can appeal
to me."

You say nothing, not sure where this is going.

***

"You have a talent, human, at identifying what people might want, what they
might need. And you come with an innocent face, making it so much better."

She sighs and points back to the rooms you've passed through with a broad,
cracked hand.

***

"My own patients have been refusing my treatment. They don't all need drugs,
but they all need something. I needed a way to get them their treatment without
them realising that is what it was."

It's starting to dawn on you.

***

"The list of goods you were meant to take? I asked those spiritlings to suggest
them to you. I infused those very items with just the right medicines for each
of my three groups of patients, and I waited as you snuck in and picked them
all up."

***

She smiles, the corners of her mouth rising beyond her tusks. "You were my
nurse this evening, human. You got my patients to take what they needed."

***

Wow. What does this mean for you?

***

"There was danger here. One can never predict what these patients will do if
dissatisfied. And because you've shown that it is no fluke you've made it this
far, I'm prepared to offer you a reward."

***

You lean forward. This conversation is going much better than you had expected.

***

"Keep whatever you still have. Consider it your earnings for nursing duties."

Ah! Excellent!

***

She stands up and walks over to the large door. "And," she says, "I offer you
safe passage home. Make your way back home, or wherever your voyages take you
next."

***

She smiles broadly and opens the door. The night air feels warm and inviting.

"Thank you for coming. Thank you for negotiating with the patients in my
Healing House."
