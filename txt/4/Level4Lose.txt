The entire time, Lepha didn't bat an eye at the items you were pulling out.
Your theft couldn't have been a surprise to her.

***

But she has looked less and less pleased, and more and more angry, as time has
gone on. And now, you sense that things are at their limit.

***

She looks at you, breathing heavily through her trunk. She seems to be
suppressing another trumpet.

Uh-oh.

***

She stands up and the roar of her voice fills the foyer. "I believed in you,
human! I gave you a chance to prove you had what it took!"

She shakes her head, ears flapping side to side. "But I see now that you've
just been lucky. Trying whatever works. It might have gotten you this far, but
I have no time for those such as you."

***

She picks you up with her trunk again. This time not gently. You try to wriggle
free, but it's no use. The power she has is too great.

***

She marches over to the front door, and yanks it open. "You wanted to escape my
home, didn't you?"

You try to scream, but the air has been squeezed out of you.

***

"Well, here you go. Get out."

And with that, her trunk winds up, taking you into the room, and then she
flings her head, whipping her trunk out the door.

***

She lets go at the farthest point, and you go sailing, flying through the air.
The wind rushes past you at an impossible speed.

***

All you can think is that you were so close. Just one negotiation away from
your freedom.

Then you collide with something hard and rough, and everything goes black.

***

And that's how you end. Death by elephant trunk.
