************************************* QUIT *************************************
As you whisper the word "quit", suddenly a powerful wind takes you up, up, and
away, out of the House of Negotiations and back to your normal life. You wake
up as if from a dream.

And yet... You shake your hair and notice as a single pomegranate seed falls to
the ground. Thank you for playing! Until next time.
