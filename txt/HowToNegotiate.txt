******************************* HOW TO NEGOTIATE *******************************
For your first negotiation, your goal is to get a key from Porridge, the boy
gorilla. But he probably won't just give you what you want for free... You have
to find a trade.

Everyone has a distinct personality. Porridge, for example, is a slightly
impulsive, but friendly kid. He's accommodating and easy to please, especially
if you offer him something he likes. Others, however, may not be quite as
straightforward.

You have a limited number of rounds before your opponent gets impatient and
gives up on you. At any time, you can type "turns" to check your deadline.

The core of the negotiation is to propose tantalising offers to your opponent.
In order to do that here, you can type "propose" to craft one by selecting
items from your inventory to package together into an offer and send it. Each
proposal uses up one turn.

Remember: be careful with your inventory. It is your primary resource. The more
you can keep, the higher your final score. So be cautious with your proposals.
