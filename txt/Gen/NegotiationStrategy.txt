----- NEGOTIATION STRATEGY -----
The spirits are fickle.

To win their favour, you must offer them a package of objects (as few or as
much as you wish).

Your goal is to be as efficient as possible -- try to offer them objects that
might appeal specifically to them. If you do, they might accept a smaller
package.

Some spirits are also just gruff by nature, and others are more friendly.
Friendly spirits will be more willing to accept weaker offers from you, but it
is up to you to judge when and how to try.

Do note: you only have a few tries before they lose patience with you. If one
offer doesn't work, try a more generous one. You only have a small inventory of
goods, and the more you retain by the end, the better you will do.
