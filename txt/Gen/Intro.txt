You heft your bag of loot. Did you get everything? Check your inventory.

***inventory***

Okay, looks like your list is covered, and then some. You take in a whiff of
the herbal scents filling the Pantry. But you cannot tarry. You must escape.

***

Should you cover your tracks? Close up each intricate box, stopper each bottle
of unguent, replace each pack of tools?

***

You suddenly feel weary. It's not worth it. They'll find out pretty quickly
what happened. You should just go. But how?

***

The moonlight sparkles in your face. You look up, and there rests your
salvation: a simple, though high, window.

***

No time to waste. Setting down your bag of loot, you spy some wooden crates
nearby. These are spirit-sized, but better than nothing. You manoeuvre them
under the window, silent as a snake.

The trouble, you realise, is in stacking such behemoths. You try to push one by
a corner onto another, and just then... you lose your balance and begin to tip.

***

The crate falls and -- curses! -- it's full of clanging brass. The crash and
echo of ringing metal is loud Loud LOUD.

***

The clinking disaster fades, only to be replaced by a far, far worse sound,
terrifying you to your very soul: a sonorous, enraged trumpet.

***

The ground shakes. She approaches.

***

Nerves jangling, you glance about. Where to hide?

In a burst of panic -- you jump into the now empty crate. You slide the lid
closed over your head. Perhaps she won't notice you in here.

***

Moments pass, and suddenly, through a crack in the lid, you see a silhouette in
the doorway. It takes form slowly in the dark.

Granite legs, thick as trees, rise up into a heaving, powerful core. Dark
leather overcoat, with flaps and pockets teeming with jars. Wide, rubbery ears,
framing a curled, vicious trunk. A height enough to graze the mountainous
ceiling. And two unnaturally reflective metal tusks, polished and sharpened to
a point.

***

This is Lepha, Pharmacologist of the Spirits, here to deliver judgment.

And judgment it will be, for you can tell right away: she sees exactly where
you are.
