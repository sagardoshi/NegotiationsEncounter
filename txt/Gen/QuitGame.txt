You can't handle this anymore. This house, these spirits, they are driving you
mad! You've gotten this far, and that feels like an achievement in itself.

Perhaps it's the only achievement left to you. Yes, perhaps it is.

You lay back, allow the failure to fill you up, and resign yourself to the
punishment coming.

***

You have quit the game. Please come back and visit the spirits again whenever
you can! They'll be waiting...
